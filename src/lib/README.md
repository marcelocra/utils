# Lib

## Utility functions - `src/lib`

The utility functions should be on their own file in the top level of this `lib`
folder

## Algorithms and data structures - `src/lib/algo`

I'm using this repo to solve some algorithms and data structure questions using
JavaScript.

They will be at `lib/algo`.
